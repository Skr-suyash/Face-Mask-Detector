# Face-Mask-Detector
A machine learning based application that tells whether a person is wearing a mask or not.

## Technologies Used
  1. Python
  2. Tensorflow and Keras
  3. [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
  4. [Haar-cascase-classifier](https://docs.opencv.org/master/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html)

## Dataset Used
Face-Mask-Detection Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection

## Description
A Deep Learning based Convolutional Neural Network is trained on the dataset using Tensorflow and Keras. Then we use OpenCV ato capture the video feed from the user's webcam and extract the face using the Haar-Cascade-Classifier and send the image for model's prediction.
